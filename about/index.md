This is a work in progress.

MajorKong.com is named for the atomic-bomb riding cowboy in [Dr. Strangelove](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/) who seemed to be having fun as he plummeted to earth, much as I often still do.

I am using thi site as a place to post my videos, track my progress, and gather information I have found helpful about learning to fly FPV.  Maybe someday it will even be a conduit for companies to send me gear to crash test!
